# Web--Scrapping
This repository has some python files, which I wrote for scrapping data from websites using Python library.

1) The first script is written to scrap the data from IMDB. The program scraps the releasing movie in the respective week and top 10 movies running in the respective week. BeautifulSoup is used as the library to scrap and the details have been exported to Excel file with Title and Running time of the movie.
2) The second program has been written to scrap Latest News & Top news from the most read daily of India i.e The Times of India website.
